# universal-IR-remote
A WiFi controlled universal IR remote control implemented on an ESP32

With this remote you can save every ir command, like an universal remote control. The difference to normal remotes is that my one can be controlled over WiFi. It has also buttons and a lcd display for standard use.

The project is acually an Arduino project, but I'm using the Visual Micro extension to use it with Visual Studio.
